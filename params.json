One is controlled by player, the other by computer.\r\nHow to play -> \r\n\t-version 1: Use your mouse to click on different rooms to repair them when you are hit (% chance to damage a room at random).\r\n\t\r\n\t*Weapons will fire automatically at enemy everytime cooldown is over or when its room is not damaged.\r\n\t\r\n\t*Shield will overload, requiring player to reactivate it (takes a few seconds to recharge).\r\n\t\r\n\t*Defense module will intercept enemy fire (% chance to intercept).\r\n\tHull Status will indicate health of the ship. If it reaches zero. player loses.\r\n\r\n\tMAYBE*** --> can target fire a certain of the enemy ship, so that the player can take out a particular module of the enemy spaceship.\r\n\r\nHow computer plays ->\r\n\t-version 1: Computer will automatically repair its over modules. similar functions to player's spaceship.\r\n\r\nHow to begin making the game ->\r\n\r\n1. Core functions\r\n- Statements to indicate Hull Points (HP) and Shield Points (SP).\r\n- Functions to fire weapon ---> timeset to hit target. Chance to hit/miss. timeset for cooldown to fire again.\r\n- Functions to take damage ---> if shield on, reduce SP, else reduce HP ++ % chance to damage a random module. Damaged modules will stop functioning.\r\n- Functions to repair different module (or rooms). Should take a few seconds to repair. Can only repair one room at a time. Modules will only function again once it is repaired. Cool down will go back to full. \r\n- Functions for Defense module --> % chance to intercept enemy fire. If damaged, will not intercept.\r\n\r\nMVP \r\n- Stage 1\r\n-> Get Weapons to work first. Then two spaceships will start shooting at each other mindlessly. \r\n\r\n- Stage 2\r\n-> Get Shields to work. If it works, two spaceships with shields will start shooting at each other.\r\n\r\n- Stage 3\r\n-> Get Defense mods to work, so not all attacks will hit its target.\r\n\r\n- Stage 4\r\n-> Get damaged status online. Meaning: damaged modules wouldn't work.\r\n\r\n- Stage 5\r\n-> Get repair function online. So players would actually be able to do something.\r\n\r\nProgress\r\n- Stage 1 - completed\r\n- Stage 2 - completed\r\n- stage 3 - completed\r\n- stage 4 - completed\r\n- additional functions --> added random damage modifier to randomise damage dealt. e.g. 100 damge +/- 20%.","note":"Don't delete this file!
