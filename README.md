Mechanism of the game
1. Stats
hp - Hull Points - basically health point. When it drops to zero, you lose. Cannot be repaired. Start with 100 hp.
sp - Shield Points - amount of damage the shield can block while it is active. Once it reaches zero, repair 'Shield' to restore 50 points to your sp. While Shield is active, no damage can be inflicted on hp. Chance to damage your ship's functions is also lower while Shield is functional. Start with 100 sp.
Shield - The shield module of your shield. When sp > 0, Shield is functioning. When sp <= 0, repair this module to restore 50 sp.
Weapon - While active, your ship will periodically fire at the enemy. When non-functional, it will stop firing.
Defense - Adds a 2 in 3 chance of intercepting an enemy fire. When down, the chance of getting hit is 100%.
Weapon - The average damage you inflict on the enemy.

2. General mechanisms.
Random modifier to damage - Every hit you inflict on the enemy will have a chance to deal any amount of damage between (base damage - 20%) to (base damage + 20%).

Damage to ship functions
- While shield is functioning - 1 in 5 chance of any of your ship's functions to be damaged.
- Shield down -  1 in 2 chance of any of your ship's functions to be damaged.

There is a textbox at the bottom of the screen that shows a brief update on the result of your weapon firing.
